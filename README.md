# WWU-Introduction-to-informatics
I did the introduction course to informatics in my university, while i was waiting for the results from my Bachelor thesis. In the course we covered functional(in Dr. Racket) and object oriented progamming( in Java). Although i did not found the course challenging, because i already had experience with both of the concepts and the respective languages it helped me practices and affirm my previouse knowledge. 
I have upload only the programming part exercises which i have done with my classmate.
